Today’s mainstream theory assumes that all of the computations of the brain are defined by the connectivity of the neural networks. The units of these computations are the summation and subtraction processes implemented by hyperpolarization and depolarization of cell membranes— which then locally “calculate” the result out of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs received through synapses from other cells.
